INTRODUCTION                                           *ma-pur-ma-intro*

The PureScript LSP is good and all - but has some missing nicities. This repo
contains macros for doing common operations while writing purse - some
operations include:
  - Extract expression to function
  - Toggle exports
  - Autofill `case`-expressions

==============================================================================
QUICK START                                       *ma-pur-ma-quickstart*

Make sure you have a tree-sitter parser installed for PureScript. Adding the
treesitter pluggin and running a quick `TSInstall purescript` should get you
settled in nicely.

This plugin can generate some poorly formatted code - it is recomended to pair
it with a formatter like `purs-tidy`.

Then generate bindings for these commands

  require"ma-pur-ma.nvim".extract_to_function()<CR> 
  require"ma-pur-ma.nvim".fill_in_data_case()<CR> 
  require"ma-pur-ma.nvim".if_to_case()<CR> 
  require"ma-pur-ma.nvim".toggle_export()<CR> 
<

Some of these commands have requirements to work. and will be discussed in
further detail.

>
  require"ma-pur-ma.nvim".extract_to_function()<CR> 
<
Place the cursor on the expression you want to extract, then trigger this
function. A new function is created above the current one with the required
arguments passed through.

>
  require"ma-pur-ma.nvim".fill_in_data_case()<CR> 
<
Write the name of the `data`-type and place your cursor on it, then trigger
this function. A case expression is then inserted with all the constructors of
the `data`-type.

>
  require"ma-pur-ma.nvim".if_to_case()<CR> 
<
Place your cursor inside an `if`-expression, then trigger this function. If
expression is replaced with corresponding `true ->` and `false ->` branches.

>
  require"ma-pur-ma.nvim".toggle_export()<CR> 
<
Place your cursor inside a top-level declaration, then trigger this function.
The *thing* is added to the front of the export list if it is not present.
If it is currently exported - it is instead removed.

Currently doesn't work with modules.
